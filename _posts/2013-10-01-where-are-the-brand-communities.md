title: Where are the brand communities?
---

## Brands gather communities around them. And where there are communities, there is a need for truth. And truth makes the best stories. The true storytellers need to live in brands, and they must practice the trade made special by journalism – telling the truth of your community, and helping them tell stories.

Douglas Crets certainly comes out swinging for the contribution 'brands' can make to journalism and the art of telling a story.

> "To truly serve the human need to know, brands need to step into this opportunity gap to hire writers and journalists. By eliminating marketing for the sake of marketing’s goals, they need to become the new epicenters of human conscience..."

Hmm. Tell you what, Douglas should start by giving us a list of all the great communities brands have gathered around them. As I said in [this post](http://markhigginson.co.uk/2013/04/27/amex-open-forum/), I don't think these communities exist, certainly not in the sense of being a genuine 'community'.

Examples please. Lots of them. I don't buy it because I've never seen it.
