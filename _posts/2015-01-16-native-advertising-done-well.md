## Native advertising done well

Few implementations [of the form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising) get it right. Here's one, which also appears on a platform where if you get it wrong, there will be consequences.

Pact Coffee [first advertised on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/comments/23y39g/an_invitation_to_uk_redditors_do_you_drink_coffee/) last year. They attracted 1,247 comments and there are a number of really good interactions between redditors and Pact's account [omfgcoffee](http://www.reddit.com/user/omfgcoffee).

They ran a [second advert](http://www.reddit.com/comments/2fzqs7/a_new_invitation_to_uk_redditors_what_does_really/) more recently which caused a few problems as new customers were being offered a very nice Hario V60 dripper -- existing customers were a little aggrieved. Pact [handled it well](http://blog.pactcoffee.com/2014/08/12/v60-balls-up-an-apology-and-a-cracking-offer-for-existing-customers/).

Their [follow-up about their experience](http://www.reddit.com/r/selfserve/comments/2laczf/were_pact_coffee_one_of_uks_first_advertisers_on/) was a clever move; r/selfserve is the subreddit for people who want to advertise on reddit so sharing this in the spirit of the community. 

With the New Year [they are back for more](http://www.reddit.com/comments/2r3mgz/uk_reddit_offer_a_new_way_to_drink_great_coffee/); I signed-up recently myself. Clearly there are dimninishing returns in terms of interactions with other redditors but it would be interesting to know the amount of business this generated.

Responses like this are gold:

What I like about the most recent advert is how well it suits the platform and how this medium suits Pact far better than a banner advert ever would:

It's longform, they strike the right tone of voice and they lay out their offer in a clear and direct way. They say who they are and what they do, focusing on the benefits of the service they offer. A nice touch is they reference the comments on their first very successful post.

Ultimately omfgcoffee is a redditor who is promoting what they do rather than Pact appearing as a brand using reddit for advertising. And that is the note you want to hit without lookng like you're trying to hit it.
