### At present, Nescafé.com plays host to a wincingly earnest collection of visual puns and feel-good images designed to promote the company's coffee, however the hope is that, over time, it will be the brand's fans that populate its content grid.

#### <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/15/9329287/nescafe-tumblr-brand-website" rel="nofollow">Nescafé declares the brand website 'dead' as it moves to Tumblr</a>

Nescafé has changed <a href="http://www.nescafe.com" rel="nofollow">its website</a>. It’s based on tumblr and features a load of ‘content’ squares that can be clicked on. They announced this by saying “the brand is looking to engage in owned media territory”. Whatever that means.

Here’s the thing: a ubiquitous brand like Nescafé is well-known because of its availability not due to any passion people feel for it. Therefore to think that re-structuring the corporate site will somehow make the brand “much more inclusive… allow conversations… (and the) possibility to co-create” is just a reiteration of some of the more absurd concepts of social media marketing.

Have a look at the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23itallstarts&src=tyah">#itallstarts</a> around which Nescafé attempts to gather interest. Next to no one uses it who isn’t already associated with Nescafé’s marketing.

The fact the web allows for a direct connection between groups of people doesn’t directly map to the desire of brand marketers to have customers publicly demonstrate enthusiasm for their product. To do so the product must have cachet and infer some kind of positive status upon the individual. Nescafé doesn’t have this.
