### In the end I think it will be the emergence of a more general social contract about how to use these new tools that will change the way we think about and use social media.

#### [Facebook and Twitter's 'non-natives' learn dangers of social media territory](http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/jan/23/facebook-twitter-natives-social-media)

I'm quoted in The Guardian. The piece is about reaction to unguarded comments that become a matter of permanent record through the use of social platforms such as Twitter, et al.

That is the significant difference: a throwaway remark is now time-stamped and keyword searchable in a database somewhere.
