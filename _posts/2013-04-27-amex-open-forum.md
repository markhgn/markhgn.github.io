title: Is the AmEx Open Forum really a community?
---

## AmEx's OPEN forum took four years to get 1 million people aboard and now gets over 150,000 unique visitors per month.

### [Digital Content Trends 2013](http://www.donotlink.com/neilperkin.typepad.com/only_dead_fish/2012/12/digital-content-trends-2013.html)

This quote is from a presentation about 'trends' in digital content. It was from a talk to the [Content Marketing Association](http://www.donotlink.com/www.the-cma.com/) and is an example of the kind of assertion I see in many presentations of this type related to ‘brands as publishers’.

The inference of the above is that AmEx is running a successful content destination: 1 million members! 150,000 unique visitors!

Click. On to the next slide. But wait. Is this true? Is the presenter simply confirming a bias they already hold and members of the CMA are likely to have?

Let us visit AmEx’s [OpenForum](http://www.donotlink.com/www.openforum.com/).

> "OPEN forum is an online community for business owners, connecting them with insights, advice, and tools to help them manage and grow their companies."

Is this a community?

Have a look at the sidebar and visit the posts under ‘most commented’. On the day I visited the five highlighted posts had no more than two comments each.

The most viewed posts had no comments on them. Strange.

Either this is a very quiet community with millions of page views or in fact there is no community here and no real readership. There is a big difference between visitors and readers; as I have previously highlighted they need to:

* Actually ** read ** the post, moving top-to-bottom at a reading pace
* Read several articles in a session or across multiple sessions
* Be a consistent repeat visitor

The OPEN forum [Facebook Page](http://www.donotlink.com/www.facebook.com/Open) shows 329,164 ‘Likes’ yet on the day I checked only 865 were ‘People Talking About This’. That is 0.26%.

Their [Twitter Profile](http://www.donotlink.com/twitter.com/openforum) has 189,815 followers yet in the past month posts have averaged low single to double digit retweets. The highest was about 26 RTs. Have a look through the follower list and see what you make of the profiles of some of these ‘people’.

Their [YouTube Channel](http://www.donotlink.com/www.youtube.com/user/americanexpressOPEN/videos?view=0&sort=p&flow=grid) has one very popular video with over 7,000,000 views yet the next most popular video only has 38,000; views then fall off a cliff. Judging from the stats this was because they probably paid for the bulk of those several million views on the top video. Anytime you see a chart that looks like a rocket lift-off and then a flat-line is a dead giveaway.

On this evidence I would be very cautious about using this as a good example. Yet here we have someone standing up in front of a bunch of people and repeating unreferenced ‘facts’ to support an argument.
Interestingly there seems to be no shortage of posts congratulating AmEx on a successful job despite no verifiable evidence this site is working as a community or content destination:

> "Beginning in 2007, OPEN forum established itself as a leading source of business insight and advice."

> ### [American Express OPEN keeps 'pulse' on small business with social media](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/feeds/american-express-open-keeps-pulse-on-small-business-with-social-media/2019)

> "This enlightened perspective has made OpenForum.com a runaway success."

> ### [What Amercian Express' Open can teach us about social media](http://www.fastcompany.com/1669407/what-american-expresss-open-can-teach-us-about-social-media)

> "Tumblr is a vibrant channel for OPEN forum and it is increasingly becoming important for its business audience."

> ### [AMEX OPEN Forum taps New York City's startup community](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2011/11/04/amex-open-forum-taps-new-york-citys-startup-community/)

None of these quotes are believable. 

__tl;dr It is disturbing, yet entirely typical of the marketing echo-chamber, to repeat these messages because it suits the narrative the industry wishes to create for itself. And marketers then stand up in front of audiences and propagate these messages, largely unchallenged.__

I feel like the kid in the story of [The Emperor’s New Clothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor's_New_Clothes).
