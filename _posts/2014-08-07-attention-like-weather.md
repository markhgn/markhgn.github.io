## Attention is like weather.

These tweets from [Mat Honan](https://twitter.com/mat/) are completely true. To my eyes attention on the web is like a weather system. There are larger forces making it all work that while we can grasp the fundamental rules the subtleties of all this in effect lie just outside our ability to predict what might happen.

This is why I rail against posts with titles like these:

* 5 Content Marketing Strategies You Should Implement Today
* Ten Rules for Mythic Content Marketing
* 7 Ways to Generate Ideas for Shareable Content

Ain't gonna happen.

I need to invent a neologism &#8211; something meteorological applied to the study of network effects on the web that expresses the seeming randomness of it all.
