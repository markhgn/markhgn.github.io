title: Attention is like weather

## Attention is like weather.

These tweets from [Mat Honan](https://twitter.com/mat/) are completely true. To my eyes attention on the web is like a weather system. There are larger forces making it all work that while we can grasp the fundamental rules the subtleties of all this in effect lie just outside our ability to predict what might happen.

This is why I rail against posts with titles like these I spot passing through my feed reader:

* 5 Content Marketing Strategies You Should Implement Today
* Ten Rules for Mythic Content Marketing
* 7 Ways to Generate Ideas for Shareable Content

The authors of these type of posts present a completely inaccurate perspective of how attention ‘works’ on the web; same goes for most people representing ‘content strategy’.
