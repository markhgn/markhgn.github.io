## Writing for the web.

These tweets from [Mat Honan](https://twitter.com/mat/) are completely true. To my eyes attention on the web is like a weather system. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>The thing about writing for the web is, you never know what&#39;s going to hit</p>&mdash; mat honan (@mat) <a href="https://twitter.com/mat/statuses/497233939681923072">August 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>People say, &quot;oh, you wrote that for the page views&quot; or whatever. But honestly I can never tell what&#39;s going to be popular, and what isn&#39;t.</p>&mdash; mat honan (@mat) <a href="https://twitter.com/mat/statuses/497234216216567808">August 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>And, like, you work your ass off on some story for months, and convince yourself It Is Your Best Work, and yet the breeze just blows</p>&mdash; mat honan (@mat) <a href="https://twitter.com/mat/statuses/497234500384870400">August 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>And then you fart something else out, accidentally or on command, and it just completely starts a riot.</p>&mdash; mat honan (@mat) <a href="https://twitter.com/mat/statuses/497234714898751488">August 7, 2014</a></blockquote>

This is why I rail against posts with titles like these:

* 'Xxxxx' lays out content formula
* 5 Content Marketing Strategies You Should Implement Today
* Ten Rules for Mythic Content Marketing
* 7 Ways to Generate Ideas for Shareable Content

Ain't gonna happen.

I need to invent a neologism - something meteorological applied to the study of network effects on the web that includes the randomness of it all.
