Headlines in a handy [haiku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) format.

Were the recently acquired Summly to summarise articles in this format I would think they were on to something. Instead I am completely puzzled as to why so much money has been spent on something that apparently does not work very well and is based on a [technology licensed from someone else](http://summly.com/technology.html). I have however witnessed and been confounded by similar deals, especially on the subject of 'big data' so cannot say I'm surprised.

This article is good to think about: [What's Actually Wrong with Yahoo's Purchase of Summly](http://hackingdistributed.com/2013/03/26/summly/). The ratio of glue vs. thought is interesting to consider in regards any project.

Thing is, I generally find the title of an article to be a more than adequate summary and use RSS to stay on top of multiple sources of content. I just do not see what problem Summly is solving.

A haiku generator however... that I would pay for handsomely.

**Update:** I was surprised to find that the haikus keep on coming; not sure they really [entirely fit the form](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kireji) however.
