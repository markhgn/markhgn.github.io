## Spiegel has a portrait of Jobs hanging in his office.

Bizarre isn't it. This article seeks to establish weak parallels between the co-founder of Snapchat and Steve Jobs. It does so by highlighting that Spiegel has a portrait of Jobs hanging in his office and has an apparently annoying tendency to micro-manage. Presumably this is to give us a sense of confidence in his leadership ability.

I haven't checked but I'm betting Jobs didn't hang the portrait of some other technology visionary on his wall, nor seek to have this mentioned in the press.
