### Spiegel has a portrait of Jobs hanging in his office.

This article seeks to establish weak parallels between the co-founder of Snapchat and Steve Jobs. It does so by highlighting that Spiegel has a portrait of Jobs hanging in his office and has an apparently annoying tendency to micro-manage. Presumably this is to give us a sense of confidence in his leadership ability.

This is the antithesis of Jobs, who I bet neither hung a portrait of some other well-known business person on his wall, nor sought to have this mentioned in the press.
