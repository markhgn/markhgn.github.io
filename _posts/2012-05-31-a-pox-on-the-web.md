### If youâ€™re unknown, social media buttons make you look like a dog waiting for the crumbs from the table.

#### [Sweep the Sleaze](http://ia.net/blog/sweep-the-sleaze/)

As I have grown older I have come to appreciate that one of the great gifts of age is a sense of perspective that, if cultivated, is useful in examining all sorts of things that seem like received wisdom, whether seemingly relevant or not.

By-the-by this is why I quoted from the linked post; I've always regarded 'sharing' buttons as a pox on the web. I strongly suspect, as with so many behaviours that are treated by marketers as universal and therefore generally applicable, only a subset of users ever click these things.
