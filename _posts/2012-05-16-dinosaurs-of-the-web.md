Some good stuff in here from Chris Poole, founder of 4chan.

"The test of a good, true community is: does it create more value than it captures... value is something that can be abstract... and by that test... harvesting user generated content and wrapping it in ads... I don't think there's value there."

Something to think vis-Ã -vis aggregators and social platforms.
