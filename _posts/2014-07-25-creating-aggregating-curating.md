## Creating, aggregating and curating.

I like the idea of using aggregated content from social platforms as a way to contextualise an event. It's the sort of thing Storify offers. However, I don't want to point people to Storify nor do I like the appearance of their embedded version or want to pay in order to be able to customise this. 

Fortunately the major platforms make embedding content trivially easy; just select the 'embed' option on an item and paste the markup into your page.  The hard part is sourcing relevant material, which despite the promise of 'user-generated content' solving this problem, remains largely something you either need to produce yourself or guide people to create.

Here's part of the base column of items I knocked up from the [Faculty of Arts Graduate Show 2014](http://markhigginson.co.uk/pages/gradshow14_test.html) ready to be dropped into a suitable template within the dreaded CMS.

For those not comfortable with the markup it's the kind of thing an hours training would solve. The ability to reformat the supplied embeds to better fit the design of a site would be an improvement as, for example, I'm unhappy with the borders on the images in portrait format on the #gradshow14 piece.

That was the super-easy part. Far more important was preparing to cover the event itself. I'm going to put up another post with a link to download my guide to live-tweeting an event in the next couple of days.
