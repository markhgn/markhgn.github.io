### Creating, aggregating and curating.

I like the idea of using aggregated content from social platforms as a way to contextualise an event. It's the sort of thing Storify offers. However, I don't want to point people to Storify nor do I like the appearance of their embedded version or want to pay in order to be able to customise this. 

Fortunately the major platforms make embedding content trivially easy; just select the 'embed' option on an item and paste the markup into your page.  The hard part is sourcing relevant material, which despite the promise of 'user-generated content' solving this problem, remains largely something you either need to produce yourself or guide people to create.

Here's part of the base column of items I knocked up from the [Faculty of Arts Graduate Show 2014](http://markhigginson.co.uk/pages/gradshow14_test.html) ready to be dropped into a suitable template within the dreaded CMS.

For those not comfortable with the markup it's the kind of thing an hours training would solve; that's the super-easy part. Far more important was preparing to cover the event itself. Get in touch with me if you'd like my guide to live-tweeting an event and I'll send you a copy.
