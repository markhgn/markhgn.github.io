### [Who Says What to Whom on Twitter](http://labs.yahoo.com/publication/who-says-what-to-whom-on-twitter/)

This PDF from Yahoo! Research is well worth your time. The findings indicate that those 'elite users' referred to above are just 0.048% of the user-base.

It also indicates that the patterns of behaviour in the Twitter universe may obey slightly different rules to the wider web. This has implications for the perception that 'conversations' occur on Twitter rather than waves of re-tweets originating from discrete sources.
