There are so many series this would work for, e.g. AMC’s The Walking Dead would have translated to being delivered this way no problem, the forthcoming Game of Thrones from HBO would work too. 

Netflix is well-known; people are becoming more familiar with the web as a primary distribution channel for video content, such as the BBC's iPlayer. So much of TV is just filling space but the stuff that is good is the stuff that really gets talked about. Must see TV is still a must see.
