### The decline and fall of social networks.

Interesting observation that [Social networks implode quickly](http://diegobasch.com/social-networks-implode-quickly).

Using search volumes as a proxy for 'level of interest' is inaccurate, especially with the advent of app-based access to social platforms, but these kind of charts are fascinating.

Is collapse an inevitable part of how these networks function?
