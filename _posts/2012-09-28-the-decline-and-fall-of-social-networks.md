## The decline and fall of social networks.

<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.co.uk/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=twitter,+myspace&cmpt=q&tz&tz&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=600&h=330"></script>

Two interesting posts [The decline and fall of social networks](https://pinboard.in/cached/6ec7d819d03d/) and [Social networks implode quickly](http://diegobasch.com/social-networks-implode-quickly).

Using search volumes as a proxy for 'level of interest' is inaccurate, especially with the advent of app-based access to social platforms, but these kind of charts are fascinating. The chart above is for MySpace and Twitter.

Is collapse an inevitable part of how these networks function?
