> “Not that much, really. It’s changed a few of details, but I really don’t think that it’s all that revolutionary. It’s another tool, but people have done really cool, fun projects in all kinds of ways. Before social media, there were pamphlets. In between pamphlets and social media, there were emails. (Twitter) is just short emails that reach a lot of people, instead of only the people they are addressed to. We’ve used it.”

Quoted from an interview with [The Yes Men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yes_Men) who are notably free of any hyperbole about ‘social media’.
