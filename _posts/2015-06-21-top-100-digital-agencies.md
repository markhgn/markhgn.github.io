### Your definitive guide to the biggest UK digital agencies

Marketing being marketing the brazen hubris of the industry comes as no surprise. This is exemplified by Econsultancy's guide to the 'top' digital agencies. The rankings are arranged by the amount these agencies have managed to bill their clients. What this measures is what has worked for the agency, not their clients.

The commentary accompanying the report states:

> "... the average fee income has increased by 25%".

Presumably with a commensurately larger multiplier in the sales of the businesses for whom these agencies produced work?
