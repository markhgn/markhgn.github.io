### The whole point of a comment is to make new information or a new opinion available. Good luck with that. As far as I can tell you cannot deep link to Facebook comments, and searching through them is at best a pain.

#### [Facebook Comments Epitomizes Everything I Hate About Facebook](http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/03/facebook-comments-epitomizes-everything-i-hate-about-facebook/)

TechCrunch have been using the Facebook Comments system and aren’t too impressed. A comment system should allow conversation, ‘replies-to-replies’, should be ‘sortable’, by date, popularity, etc. and has to be searchable.

On would expect Facebook to be making rapid improvements in a number of areas, not only technically, e.g. search functionality but with the fundamental principles of how one’s social graph is organised and accessed. However given that 'the product' is the users of the platform 'innovation' seems to be reserved for work on the advertising side of things.
