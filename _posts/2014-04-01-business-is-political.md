## Business is political

OkCupid have [weighed in](http://valleywag.gawker.com/okcupid-blocks-firefox-over-anti-gay-ceo-1555611770) on the [Brendan Eich gay marriage issue](https://brendaneich.com/2014/03/inclusiveness-at-mozilla/) by inserting a splash screen for Firefox users actively dissuading them from using this browser to access their website.

You could argue this is a fantastic piece of marketing by OkCupid. Their business is inclusivity and here they get to underline their values in opposition to those of Mozilla's CEO. That said, I'm interested to know what the drop-off rate is for Firefox users clicking away from OkCupid as a result.

I do admire OkCupid for taking this stance as pretty much all businesses maintain an apolitical veneer. This is of course completely disingenuous as being in business is a political act, often framed by and contributing to the dominant discourse.
