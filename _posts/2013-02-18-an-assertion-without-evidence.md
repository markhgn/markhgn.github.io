title: An assertion without evidence
---

## For many consumers recording an experience has become more important than the experience itself.

### 'Marketing Magazine' 6th February 2013

So says Toby Barnes, 'Product Strategy Director' at AKQA.

Who these 'many consumers' are is not defined in the article. No evidence is presented to substantiate this claim. Philistinism runs amok in the marketing world. I wonder if this person has read any Baudrillard.

**Update:** Toby's description on his Twitter profile reads "Infiltrate, understand, then interfere". I could write an essay on why that assumptive and inappropriate statement is problematic.
