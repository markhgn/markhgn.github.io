title: Clearing 2014

## Advertising university Clearing via social platforms.

Today was A-Level results day which also means [Clearing](http://www.ucas.com/how-it-all-works/undergraduate/results/if-you-have-no-offers) &#8211; the process by which students without an offer contact universities with space on a course they wish to study. By the afternoon it's largely all over. The whole process of university application, governed by UCAS, makes for a highly constrained set of circumstances as students check their results and, if necessary, see who has courses available.

From a marketing point-of-view it's interesting to think about the psychology of the individual going through this process. Above all you need to be helpful, sensitive and treat them as more than a set of grades and a warm body to place on a course. From a social platform perspective it's important to remember that Clearing is irrelevant to the majority of followers of a university's page.

My favoured approach is to provide relevant information, i.e. the number of the Clearing line for anyone happening by our social profile on the day. That's it. On Twitter I share the occasional nice tweet from excited students who are glad to have their place confirmed. The reason is simple &#8211; an emotional response from someone on such an important day is good to share and a reminder for a good proportion of the people who follow the university profiles of their own results day, as they are or have been students themselves.

Spamming your own stream is a no-no. The University of Sussex were posting course-specific entry requirements to little or no response: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Interested in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Philosophy?src=hash">#Philosophy</a>? We have places available through <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Clearing?src=hash">#Clearing</a> - BBB required. Call us on 01273678416.</p>&mdash; University of Sussex (@SussexUni) <a href="https://twitter.com/SussexUni/statuses/499848199621079040">August 14, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I very much doubt people are using Twitter to search for available courses. A test would be to create a campaign based on this keyword with the objective of a 'website conversion' or 'leads on Twitter'. You'd then keep these tweets out of your own timeline and could properly measure the reaction.

As a general rule I only 'speak when spoken to' when representing the institution. Barging in is poor etiquette, as we can see here:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SussexUni">@SussexUni</a> oh Sussex at least buy me dinner first</p>&mdash; emily alderton (@emilyalderton) <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyalderton/statuses/499930875728248833">August 14, 2014</a></blockquote>

If you do this enough times it's bound to go wrong:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nick_Pettigrew">@Nick_Pettigrew</a> HI Nick - amazing results! What are you hoping to study? We&#39;ve got a few spaces left in clearing: <a href="http://t.co/3q4MPCLeyP">http://t.co/3q4MPCLeyP</a></p>&mdash; University of Sussex (@SussexUni) <a href="https://twitter.com/SussexUni/statuses/499833663283281920">August 14, 2014</a></blockquote>

... and you end up with your best performing tweet of the day and appearances on [Buzzfeed](http://www.buzzfeed.com/alanwhite/two-universities-asked-a-guy-to-apply-to-them-because-they-d#49a62zx) and [The Huffington Post](http://www.donotlink.com/www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/08/14/man-tweets-fake-a-level-results-offered-places-unis_n_5677712.html).

This was even worse:

Ultimately one should consider when taken as a whole whether this both best represents the institution and whether it's effective at helping students find a suitable course on which they'll be happy. I'd suggest not. In my opinion Sussex get the tone wrong.

For an event such as Clearing paid advertising gets the best results without requiring a huge budget as your goal is to gain significant reach within a limited time frame. The other advantage is that it keeps these specific messages away from your existing followers and, through targeting, hopefully reaches relevant people.

It's also important to remember that social media provides a supporting role among many other factors influencing a decision. This year we led with a [short film made by two students](http://youtu.be/u871PBefGp0) which was a low-key look at life in Brighton. It conveys a sense of mood and place and has nothing to do with grades and league tables. For the right person it implicitly communicates that Brighton is a place that would suit them. For the prospective student considering their options it's a nice way of putting the university forward without a hard sell.

This film was combined with a few sponsored posts and promoted tweets pointing people to our main site. Overall our campaign needed:

* 220 people to see a post...
* ... to get 15 people to take an action
* ... to result in one person following an applicable link

Around 15,000 people interacted with things we created and posted to Facebook, Twitter or YouTube and each was linked by the 'living here' theme. Given the limitations on our ability to directly target people in Clearing and having to use the proxy of age, other interests, etc. when creating our adverts this was a good result.

I generally dislike 'awareness' as an objective as it isn't immediately measurable but where specific content is available it can be useful, especially in the run-up to a specific event, hence the use of the video in conjunction with other activity in this case.

Typically I regard 'paid social' as the unspeakable in pursuit of the unmeasurable as this activity is very traditional in its nature, even if the mechanism is different. To my eyes this isn't social media as none of this is peer-to-peer sharing; it's advertising using data people have either explicitly or incidentally made available to the social network whose advertising functionality we happen to be using.

Interestingly this thread on reddit worked very well: [Some UCAS / Uni Advice](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2dinos/some_ucasuni_advice/?sort=top) with 82,000 readers, around 400 users on the thread at any one time and several hundred comments.
