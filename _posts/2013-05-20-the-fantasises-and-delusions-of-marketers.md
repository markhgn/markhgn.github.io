title: The fantasies and delusions of marketers

## It was all fantasies and delusions based on naive interpretations of consumer behavior by people who had a whole lot of ideological commitment to the web, and very little experience with real world marketing

Spot on about the ideological commitment; see the faux-naive idea of [markets as conversations](http://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html) for a whole lot more on what amounts to a neo-liberal capitalist ideal that was very attractive to some.

What has struck me about working in the area of online marketing is both how much of my work is really about public relations and how much I had to learn given I had no prior experience in this area. What was also surprising was how traditional PR was actually based on very simple principles with a lot of meetings and handwaving to confuse the uninitiated.

The wider point in the post I quote from above is that the current vogue for talking about 'native advertising', hand-in-hand with the dread 'content marketing', is that it is a very traditional concept. The savvy individual should be aware by now that not only do people ignore display advertising it is a sector [riven by fraud](http://www.spider.io/blog/2013/03/chameleon-botnet). However, in the search for an alternative that works the physicality of the medium is still ignored. The reason a magazine advert 'works' is that the medium requires me to physically turn a page and I expect to have to turn the pages to proceed: it is full-page. A television advert 'works' because I have no choice whether the advert appears in front of my eyes or not: it is full-screen. A billboard 'works' because it is large: it fills my field of vision.

People's tolerance to advertising that appears on the web is very different, which affects implementation and performance. This is why Yahoo! is not going to recoup the money it has spent on tumblr through advertising.
