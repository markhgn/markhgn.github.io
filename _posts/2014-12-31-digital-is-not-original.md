title: Digital is not original

## Digital is about reproducing something so it’s exact. Media is about making something original.

### [Michael Wolff on digital media in 2015: ‘A deluge of crap’](http://digiday.com/publishers/michael-wolff-digital-media-2015-deluge-crap/)

The whole article I’ve taken the above quote from is great.

> “BuzzFeed is a tech company. One which is wholly focused on aggregrating a mass audience. It has no other value beyond that.”

Of course, that mass audience is distributed on a very long tail so the usefulness to marketers to get their messages to people is minimal. However, it suits Buzzfeed that the industry thinks otherwise. Their content machine is a very hungry beast that needs constant feeding; if marketers pay to help Buzzfeed grow then this is to their advantage.

On ‘Vice’:

> “Their entire effort is to literally get themselves a cable channel. They’ve played an interesting game: They created a brand. They’re not a tech company. They’re a real, traditional media company.”
