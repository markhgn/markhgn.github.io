title: Digital is not original
---

## Digital is about reproducing something so it’s exact. Media is about making something original.

### [Michael Wolff on digital media in 2015: ‘A deluge of crap’](http://digiday.com/publishers/michael-wolff-digital-media-2015-deluge-crap/)

The whole article I’ve taken the above quote from is great.

> “BuzzFeed is a tech company. One which is wholly focused on aggregrating a mass audience. It has no other value beyond that.”

I'd disagree that Buzzfeed have a mass 'audience' however. They have massive 'traffic' in the ephemeral sense of visitors coming and going but I wonder if this is an audience in the sense of people deliberately choosing Buzzfeed as a source of entertainment rather than just a place they end up on from a shared link. 

Buzzfeed's visitors will be distributed on a very long tail so the usefulness to marketers to get their messages to people is minimal. However, it suits Buzzfeed that the industry thinks otherwise. Their content machine is a very hungry beast that needs constant feeding; if marketers pay to help it grow then this is to Buzzfeed's advantage.

On ‘Vice’:

> “Their entire effort is to literally get themselves a cable channel. They’ve played an interesting game: They created a brand. They’re not a tech company. They’re a real, traditional media company.”

Again, I wonder if this is sustainable? They'll have to keep the cost of producing original stories in check while the complexity of what they are doing increases.
