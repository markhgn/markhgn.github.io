title: Digg and reddit
---

### Startups in Silicon Valley are like old generals. They don’t die anymore, buoyed on life-rafts of lingering venture capital and modest revenues. It’s pretty clear that Digg is on that path.

#### [RIP Digg](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/19/rip-digg/)

Ignoring the self-aggrandising of the author, this is worth marking as the lessons we learn from the start-ups that fade away are valuable. Points to consider are why [reddit is beating Digg](http://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#q=reddit%2C%20digg) and how both compare to similar sites like [MetaFilter](http://www.metafilter.com/) and the recently deceased [Plastic.com](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic.com).

Does anyone remember [Pownce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pownce)?
