## There is no way these huge companies can provide the same intimate level of customer service that I can, especially since I don’t have that many customers.

### [How 1-man band Jerry Shen makes most of buyout by Yahoo](http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/How-1-man-band-Jerry-Shen-makes-most-of-buyout-by-6082952.php?t=ce33d856447d4f3860&cmpid=twitter-premium#/0)

This article epitomises why I don't 'get' Yahoo.

Jerry Shen, who developed a fantasy sports app, cites the fact he responds immediately to customer enquiries as what differentiates him in the marketplace. That's how he wins recommendations.

> "Large competitors like Yahoo and the NFL soon launched their own mobile fantasy sports apps, and Shen tried to think of ways he could differentiate his product. His solution: charm customers with great customer service, responding to any complaints within five minutes."

Yahoo has likely paid a lot of money to accquire his business. Jerry's apps are gone.

> "He became a director of engineering at the tech giant, managing a team that works on Yahoo’s fantasy sports apps."

Hell of an expensive way to recruit someone. Perhaps Jerry is much more talented than anyone else at creating these apps so this will give Yahoo an advantage. But that isn't how the article portrays Jerry's success. It doesn't sound like Jerry will be doing customer service or that facet is part of Yahoo's plan.
