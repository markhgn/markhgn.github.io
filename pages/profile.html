    <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2>

        <p>I'm interested in the social aspects of technology and how this is applied to marketing.</p>

        <p>Here’s what I said about the web’s impact on this at a recent speaking engagement:</p>

            <blockquote>
                
                <p>"In simplistic terms we’ve always known people talk about the decisions they make in their lives... the shift has been that technology has turned what was once ephemeral into something that is publicly searchable and retrievable, amplifying the potential effect of an opinion to include groups of people potentially only tangentially related to one another... as well as allowing these opinions to persist over time, e.g. through related web searches."</p>
            
            </blockquote>

          <p>I run an agency that focuses on turning this understanding into successful outcomes for our clients.</p>

          <p>I won gold for 'Best Article'​ at the 2014 Canadian Online Publishing Awards for a piece on Coca-Cola's content marketing published on Sparksheet.</p>

          <p>I've spoken at numerous events, workshops and appeared on panels including:</p>

          <p>
            CASE Europe: 'Social media for Student Communications'​ (rated 4.56 out of 5 -- a 'Stellar score'​).<br>
            Social Media Results: 'Involving stakeholders in generating innovative content'​.<br>
            Youth Marketing Strategies: 'Discover how your brand can partner with students'​.<br>
            Discovering Futures: 'Reach, relevance, and reaction: marketing HE in an age of social media'​.<br>
          </p>

            <blockquote>

                <p>"Brilliant! The best session - and lots of food for thought."​</p>

                <p>"Fantastic talk about social media and a very alternative approach."​</p>

                <p>"Favourite presentation so far, a great teardown of most universities'​ social media strategies."​</p>

                <p>"Best talk today by a mile. Really interesting take on how to look at the challenges."​</p>

                <p>"￼Fascinating perspective on Facebook custom audiences."​</p>

            </blockquote>

          <p>I've also been quoted in the Guardian, The Metro, New Media Age and Marketing magazine among others in reference to my work.</p>

    <h3>Managing Director</h3>
    <h4>TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES</h4>
    <h4>May 2016 &#8211; Present</h4>

        <p>TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES specialises in innovative decision assistance marketing for higher education student recruitment.</p>

        <p>I set this business up when it became apparent that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2014/sep/18/removing-cap-student-numbers-six-questions-hepi-report">removal of the cap</a> on student control numbers would increase competition betweeen universities and as such they would face challenges in marketing to prospective students. What concerned me was that the higher education sector would find itself exposed to the smoke-and-mirrors that plagues the rest of the marketing sector in relation to online advertising. TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES is a response to that.</p>
